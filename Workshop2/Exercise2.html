    <h2>“Fear is not evil. It tells you what weakness is. And once you know your weakness,
         you can become stronger as well as kinder.” — Gildarts Clive (Fairy Tail)</h2>
    <p>Music has always been my go-to hobby for any and all circumstances. 
    Music has always been a passion of mine since I was a youngster. 
    There are movies of me being hyperactive as a youngster whenever music was played. 
    I'd dash to the stereo, crank up the volume, and begin racing around the room dancing. 
    My rage would be directed at anyone who attempted to touch the sound system.
    Music was the one thing that could make me feel better when I was upset.</p>
